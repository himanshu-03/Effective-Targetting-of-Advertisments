## Effective Targetting of Advertisments



## 📌 Problem Definition
In this project, we will work with the advertising data of a marketing agency to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts if a particular user will click on an advertisement. 

The  data consists of 10 variables: `Daily Time Spent on Site`, `Age`, `Area Income`, `Daily Internet  Usage`, `Ad Topic Line`, `City`, `Male`, `Country`, `Timestamp` and `Clicked on Ad`. 
The main variable we are interested in is `Clicked on Ad`. This variable can have two possible  outcomes: 0 and 1 where 0 refers to the case where a user didn't click the advertisement, while  1 refers to the scenario where a user clicks the advertisement. 

We will see if we can use the other 9 variables to accurately predict the value `Clicked on Ad`  variable. We will also perform some exploratory data analysis to see how `Daily Time Spent  on Site` in combination with `Ad Topic Line` affects the user's decision to click on the add.

## 📓 Overview

| Machine Learning Models Applied            | Accuracy |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 93% |
| Logistic Regression | 90% |
| Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning | 96% |

## 👉 Application

Predict the probability of user clicking the ad which is shown to them on the partner websites
for the next 7 days based on historical view log data, ad impression data and user data. Since
every individual may have a different view of your brand, stories or slogans can resonate with
everyone differently. Through target marketing, you can better understand each customer's
needs and create a marketing campaign that targets a specific audience, so you can meet their
expectations.
